Time Tracker

This is a very basic time tracking utility with a reporting option. The need for this arose when I needed an easy way to report time to different organizations, or different projects. My requirements were that it should be with as least amount of effort as possible, and record time in a reportable format. 

This program achieves both those issues. It runs as a Windows task bar item and links itself with the shortcut keys Win + Q. This can be triggered from any program on the computer. Doing this will start a timer. When doing Win + Q again you'll get a small prompt to choose the activity you just timed. These are set up ahead of time from the Activities menu. This is then logged to the database. 

Reporting is done by right-clicking the tray icon and selecting reports. From here you can choose date options and run reports from your logged history. Exporting to CSV is available.
